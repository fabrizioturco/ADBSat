# ADBSat (Aerodynamic Database for Satellites)
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Always keep a [Unreleased] section at the top for tracking changes

## [Unreleased (F. Turco)]
### Changed
- Year in environment function no longer fixed but changeable via input --> changes in ADBSATFcn and examples to accunt for that
- axlength in plot_surfq_LVLH enlarged
### Added
- Functions ADBSATFcn_euler and calc_coeff_euler which consider attitude input as yaw, pitch, and roll angle (F. Turco)
- Function plotsurfq_LVLH which plots in LVLH system, considering yaw, pitch, and roll angle of satellite (F. Turco)
- Outputs Cf_b, Cf_LVLH, and C_D to calc_coeff_eulerAngles
- Plot of v_rel to plot_surfq_LVLH
### Removed
### Fixed
